### What are CMR ?
Car Maintenance Reminder is a web application in which all vehicle owners must register because it helps motorists to register all their vehicle data in one place, provides service providers with a high rating, and allows setting up Regular maintenance reminders. What distinguishes the application is the unique reminder system that sends notifications for all upcoming appointments, and periodic maintenance bills can also be recorded, which will benefit in evaluating the vehicle in case of a sale, and the personal profile for the vehicle that collects all important information such as the chassis number, model, color and appropriate oil.
